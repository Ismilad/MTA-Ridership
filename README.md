# Post Covid-19 Pandemic MTA Ridership Analysis
## Introduction
This in-depth analysis delves into the post-pandemic ridership landscape, uncovering key trends, behavioral shifts, and emerging patterns in travel. By exploring real-time data, forecasting future demand, and assessing transit adaptation strategies, we gain valuable insights into how public transportation is evolving and what lies ahead for the city's dynamic transit ecosystem.
## Key Notes
* The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is the backbone of public transport in New York, connecting 12 counties in the southeastern part of the state. It also serves two counties in southwestern Connecticut under a contract with the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT).
* Access-A-Ride (AAR) provides transportation for eligible riders with disabilities who can't use buses or subways, ensuring accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
* MTA Bridges and Tunnels (B&T) manages seven bridges and two tunnels in NYC and oversees the Central Business District Tolling Program (CBDTP).
* Bus service within New York City is operated by MTA agencies New York City Transit (NYCT) and MTA Bus Company (MTABC).
* The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is North America's busiest commuter railroad, connecting Manhattan to Suffolk County on Long Island. 
* The Metro-North Railroad (MNR) connects Manhattan to the Bronx, Hudson Valley, and Connecticut, making it North America's second-busiest commuter rail.
* The MTA Staten Island Railway (SIR) is Staten Islandâ€™s only rapid transit line, running 24/7 between St. George and Tottenville, with ferry connections to Manhattan. 
* Subway service within New York City is operated by MTA New York City Transit (NYCT).
## Objectives
* Tracking ridership trends in different sectors over time.
* Identifying patterns and connections between sectors.
* Forecasting for future demands.
* Using insights to shape decision to advocate for future demand.
## Conclusion
With ridership expected to rise, optimizing scheduling, capacity planning, and service expansion will be key to accommodating future demand. 
## Recommendation
Transit authorities, policymakers, and urban planners must use these insights to develop data-driven strategies, ensuring that public transportation remains accessible, reliable, and adaptable to changing patterns.
